Database Setup:
==============

To enable the creation and (forced) dropping of databases, you'll need
a superuser account on the database server. I recommend an account
separate from the normal database superuser.

To create the administrator user, use the command

  $ createuser -d -E -i -l -P -s pg-harness

as a PostgreSQL superuser. Make sure you enter a password that is NOT
used for any other critical infrastructure since you'll need to put
the password in the INI file. (You can change the user names here to
anything you like, just make sure the INI file reflects any changes
you make.)

To provide access to the temporary databases, you'll also need an
unprivileged user. This user will only have access to the temporary
databases that are created by the harness:

  $ createuser -D -E -i -l -P -S pg-harness-test

Enter a password and put that password in the INI file. Only the user
name is used during normal operation of the harness, so any problems
with the password will only become apparent once your tests actually
try to connect.
